    'This hands-on live remote workshop will teach you how to incorporate the latest accessibility testing tools into your web development workflow.',
}

Learn advanced techniques for incorporating accessibility into your web development workflow. Using the latest tools, we can write a variety of tests for accessibility and prevent issues from making it to production.

Accessibility automation can typically catch up to 50% of issues, and it's improving by the day. Automation can free up some time to test for accessibility manually, which will also always be necessary. However, by writing reliable automated tests that assert things like keyboard operability, ARIA states, and other common accessibility requirements, we can bake quality into our applications and potentially sleep better at night.

You might wonder, should I use Jest and Testing Library? Cypress? Cypress Component Testing? Puppeteer? Learn about the many automated tools at your disposal and their strengths and weaknesses, and you'll gain understanding of how to configure accessibility tests that serve your team's needs.

This workshop is intended for intermediate to advanced web developers. Some experience with React and JavaScript testing will be helpful, but not required.
