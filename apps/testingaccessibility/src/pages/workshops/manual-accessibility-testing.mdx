    'This hands-on live remote workshop will teach you how to evaluate webpages for accessibility using a variety of modern tools and repeatable processes.',
}

Learn how to incorporate accessibility into your development process and leave the Web better than you found it. This workshop will teach you how to evaluate webpages for accessibility using a variety of modern tools and repeatable processes.

There's no getting around it: many parts of accessibility testing need to be done manually. Developers are in a unique position to make an impact on accessibility with each and every commit. By making manual accessibility testing a core part of your development process, you can prevent technical debt and ship code that works for more people.

From keyboard testing to browser DevTools and web extensions, manual accessibility testing is more powerful than ever before. In this workshop, you'll learn recommended testing steps and accessibility requirements used by the pros so they become second nature.

This workshop is intended for web developers of all skill and experience levels. Some knowledge of the Web Platform would be helpful (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
